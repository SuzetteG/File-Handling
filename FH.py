#File Handling - Reading and Writing Files in Python:
#Opening a File - Using the open() function to open a file.
#Reading and Writing Files - Using read(), readline(), readlines() for reading and write(), 
# writelines() for writing.
#Closing a File - Using the close() method to close a file after operations are done.
#File Modes - Different modes for opening files like 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append), 
# 'b' (binary), etc.

#Learning Objectives:
#Understand how to open, read, write, and close files in Python.
#Store and retrieve structured data using text files.
#Build interactive programs for data magemnagemnt.
#Practice advanced file handling with real-world examples.
